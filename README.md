# Hello there! 👋 I'm Akash

I'm a Master's student in Computer Science at the University of Utah, where I contribute to research in the field of `Data Management with AI`. Previously, I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from the University of Mumbai where I was primarily involved in honing my ML skills and building projects around it, while also creating full stack apps using React.js and Node.js. 

### What I Do
- I’m a Teaching Assistant for Web Software Development at the University of Utah, helping students debug code, understand concepts, and complete assignments. Tech stack - `React.js`, `FastAPI`, `SQLite`.
- I’m deeply interested in Distributed Systems, ask me about `GFS`, `CAP, `BigTable` and more! Love to engage in talks revolving consistency models and DS as a whole!
- I also enjoy working with `MERN` stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) to build engaging user experiences from the ground up.
- Exploring ways to improve `CI/CD` pipelines and automate workflows, ensuring smooth deployments and efficient software delivery.
- Always looking for opportunities to integrate intelligent algorithms into projects, adding predictive capabilities and unlocking new realms.


If you’re looking for a developer (or a buddy) who loves problem-solving and innovation—or just want to talk sports, feel free to browse my repositories or get in touch. I’m excited to work on projects that make an impact!
