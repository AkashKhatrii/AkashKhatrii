# Hello there! 👋 I'm Akash

I'm a Master's student in Computer Science at the University of Utah, where my fascination with technology has grown into a passion for creating impactful software solutions.

### What I Do
- **Full-Stack Development**  
  I enjoy working with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) to build engaging user experiences from the ground up.
- **DevOps**  
  I'm exploring ways to improve CI/CD pipelines and automate workflows, ensuring smooth deployments and efficient software delivery.
- **Machine Learning**  
  I'm always looking for opportunities to integrate intelligent algorithms into projects, adding predictive capabilities and unlocking new possibilities.

### Outside the Code
- When I'm not at my desk, you'll likely find me on a field or in the stands, enjoying sports and staying active.
- I believe in the power of collaboration and thrive in environments that encourage knowledge-sharing and teamwork.

### Let’s Connect
